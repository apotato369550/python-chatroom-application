# python-chatroom-application
A simple GUI chatroom application made in python

##Hello Everyone!

This was one of my very first original projects made purely in Python. I had a lot of fun learning and building stuff with Tkinter.

The chatroom application is essentially a discord clone (minus the voice chat). You host chat servers on your LAN and people can connect to it directly via your LAN ipv4 address.

To run it, simply run "main.py".

I learned a lot about threading and sockets thanks to this project. It freezes every now and then, but it gets the job done:)

Have fun and enjoy.
