----- Hello User and welcome to Supr Simple Chatroom~! -----

With this application, you can now:
    - Learn more about Local Area Networks, networks, connections, and the internet
    - Create and connect to super secret, anonymous chatrooms with no fuss
    - Every chatroom is password protected and is hosted discretely in it's own port, which means no uninvited guests!
    - Messages sent through the application are never stored physically or virtually after shutting down the chat,
    which means you'll leave no trace of any interaction behind whatsoever!!!
    - Chat with anyone connected to your internet!





How to use:

    To connect to a chatroom:
        1.) Head over to the "Connect" tab, you'll see the tabs located just below the toolbar, but above the interface.
        2.) Enter the LAN IP address of the machine you wish to connect.
        3.) Enter the port where the chatroom is being hosted in.
        4.) Enter the username/alias you wish to be known as.
        5.) Enter a password, the person hosting the chatroom may or may not inform you of the password, or there may
        be no password whatsoever.
        6.) Click "Connect!" and you should be good to go:)

    To host a chatroom:
        1.) Head over to the "Host" tab. If you don't already know where it is, just follow step one of how to connect
        to a chatroom, but this time you're looking for the "Host" tab.
        2.) Enter the port where you want your chatroom to be hosted in.
        3.) Enter a password. Leave it blank if you want to make your chatroom public. Make sure to inform your other
        users of the password, if any, for them to be able to connect to the chatroom.
        4.) Click "Host!" and a window should pop up.





We understand that it may be too time consuming for someone to type up the same IP address, or port, or username, and
password again and again, so we've taken the liberty to include a configurations tab to help with that.





How to create, edit, and delete configurations:
        1.) Hit the "Settings" button on the toolbar
        2.) It should open up a window where you're able to create, edit, and delete configurations. There are two tabs,
        one for server configurations, and one for client configurations.
        Client configurations are made for connecting to servers through the "Connect" tab.
        Server configurations are made for hosting client connections through the "Host" tab.
        3.)
            To delete a configuration:
                a.) Select a configuration from the list of configurations available
                b.) Click "Delete Configuration"

            To create/save a configuration:
                a.) Fill in the fields required
                b.) Click "Save Configuration"

            To edit a currently existing configuration:
                a.) Select a configuration from the list box
                b.) Click "Edit Configuration"
                c.) The fields will be filled with the info of selected configuration.
                d.) Edit the fields necessary
                e.) Click "Save Configuration"




How to load configurations:
        1.) Go to either the "Connect" or "Host" tab.
        2.) Click the "Load" button. A window with available configurations should appear.
        3.) Select the configuration you wish to load.
        4.) Click "Load"





Managing a server:
    Server information can be seen in the "Details" tab of the server window. Information like the LAN IP of the machine,
    the port where the server is hosted, and the amount of time the server has been active can also be seen.

    There are several things you can do when hosting a server using our application. These can be viewed in the "Actions"
    tab of the server window. There, you can choose to kick, mute, or deafen users, change the room name, or shut down the
    server entirely.

    All actions and events are recorded in the "Log" tab.


The rest of the application is pretty easy to grasp. Any problem that occurs can be easily solved by CLOSING AND RE-OPENING
THE APPLICATION.

Note: This application can only work between computers in THE SAME NETWORK. Which means it can't connect to machines
connected to other networks.

That's all you need to know. Thank you for using Supr Simple Chatroom!
